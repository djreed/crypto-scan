The concept for this app is a crypto-currency price tracking and trend analyizing website. Users will be able to access and track various cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges, and set up email alerts for price breakpoints (above, below) or for sales opportunities (matching across exchanges, arbitrage). Users, once they have created an account, will be able to view the individual prices for different exchanges (all currencies on the exchange) or for different currencies (prices for the currency across different exchanges). From either location, users will be able to set up trackers for the currencies they wish to follow prices for (or for exchanges they wish to monitor, if they have invested in a specific exchange). Users will be able to search for currencies by their lowest prices, such that our app will be able to provide which exchange will offer the best buy/sell prices, including transaction rates. Graphs for the different prices and exchanges will be visible on the respective sites.

The public API that will be used, primarily, is "https://www.cryptocompare.com/api", which will be used to access prices and exchanges over time. The database will store the historic data over time for each currency and exchange, such that trends will be easy to show for the user.

As data is collected from the API, it will be simultaneously provided to users listening on specific websockets alongside the database insert. Using this data flow, users following a specific currency or exchange, or viewing either, will be able to monitor the currencies and exchanges in real time. The specific data being pushed to users will be the price of a given currency at a specific time, and the exchange the price is drawn from, OR the prices for currencies for a given exchange.
